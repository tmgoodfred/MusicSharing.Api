# MusicSharing API Documentation

## Overview
The **MusicSharing API** is a RESTful **.NET 8** backend for managing users, songs, playlists, comments, ratings, categories, followers, analytics, and more.

- **Authentication:** JWT (Bearer)
- **Intended clients:** Web and mobile frontends (for example, Angular)

---

## Base URL

- **Production:** `http://192.168.1.217:5000/api/`  
- **Development:** `http://192.168.1.217:5000/api/`

---

## Authentication

- **Type:** JWT Bearer Token  
- **Login Endpoint:** `POST /api/user/login`  
- **Header:**
```
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

**How to obtain a token:**  
Send username/email and password to `/api/user/login`. The successful response will include a JWT token.

## CORS

- CORS is enabled for frontend development (e.g., `http://localhost:4200` for Angular).
- Adjust allowed origins in your backend CORS policy as needed for production.

---

## Required Headers

For protected endpoints include:
```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

(Use `multipart/form-data` for file uploads.)

---

## Business Rules

- Only the owner or an admin can update or delete a song, playlist, or user.
- Only authenticated users can comment, rate, upload, or follow.
- Admin-only endpoints are marked in the endpoint tables.

---

## Error Handling

- Standard HTTP status codes are used (`400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `500`, etc.).
- Error responses are JSON:
```json
{
  "error": "Description of the error."
}
```

---

## Special Notes

- **File Uploads:** Use `multipart/form-data` for song uploads.
- **Authorization:** Use JWT in the `Authorization` header for protected endpoints.
- **CORS:** Ensure your frontend origin is allowed in backend CORS policy.
- **Paths shown in examples** (e.g., `/mnt/user/...`) represent server filesystem locationsâ€”do not expose internal paths in public documentation if unnecessary.
